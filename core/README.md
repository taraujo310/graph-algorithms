# The Core...

So, here will be the basis: the InputReader and a serie of diferents graph representations models. I pretend to code the 3 strategies for representing graphs: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List and Edge List. The use of these representations will be determined by the user by calling the graph constructor

`graph = Graph.new('filename', :strategie_name)`

where `filename` is referring to a file generated by the [GraphGenerator][1].
