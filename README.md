# Graph Algorithms

My goal here is to implement classic graph algorithms using Ruby. I choose this language mostly for the following reasons:

- I love Ruby! <3
- It's easier to test
- I can focus on the algorithm instead of the memory allocation management or other underlying details
- I can improve my Object-Oriented Design skills while I'm learning graphs.

## Tests

I'll use [Minitest][1] for this job. For now I don't know any list os best practices using minitest so... I'll be glad if you have some suggestions!

This is my first time using Minitest...

## Algorithms

Here is the list with the algorithms implemented. I'll try to write an overview and put together.

- [Depth First Search][12]

## So...

So this is it! :)
